# Assignment-1-The-Game-Of-Pig-
In this firs assignment from my CMPE 212 java OOP class, we were told to design a game called "The game of pig". 
This is a luck game of a player against the computer. 
When you roll a double you are rewarded with points, but if you roll a one, than your turn is over.
